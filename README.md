# AoM-Hundred

A Clojure library designed to get a plain-text list of Art of Manliness's [100 Must Read Books][aom-hun].
Uses the [enlive][enl] library to parse the HTML and suck out the names and authors of the books.
The file `books.txt` contains all one hundred books, as it looks after a little hand-finishing.
